# NestBoxCam
An ESP32Cam based project for streaming video from a nestbox with light source from RGB LED strip.
The project is configured to use the APA102 led strip but can be easily changed within via the FastLEDs library configuration.

Web interface controls added for turning the LEDs on/off and controlling their brightness. No controls added yet for colour control.
